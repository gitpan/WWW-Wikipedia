NAME
    WWW::Wikipedia - Automated interface to the Wikipedia

SYNOPSIS
      use WWW::Wikipedia;
      my $wiki = WWW::Wikipedia->new();

      ## search for 'perl' 
      my $result = $wiki->search( 'perl' );

      ## if the entry has some text print it out
      if ( $result->text() ) { 
          print $result->text();
      }

      ## list any related items we can look up 
      print join( "\n", $result->related() );

DESCRIPTION
    WWW::Wikipedia provides an automated interface to the Wikipedia
    <http://www.wikipedia.org>, which is a free, collaborative, online
    encyclopedia. This module allows you to search for a topic and return
    the resulting entry. It also gives you access to related topics which
    are also available via the Wikipedia for that entry.

INSTALLATION
    To install this module type the following:

        perl Makefile.PL
        make
        make test
        make install

METHODS
  new()
    The constructor. You can pass it a two letter language code, or nothing
    to let it default to 'en'.

        ## Default: English
        my $wiki = WWW::Wikipedia->new();

        ## use the French wiki instead
        my $wiki = WWW::Wikipedia->new( language => 'fr' );

    WWW::Wikipedia is a subclass of LWP::UserAgent. If you would like to
    have more control over the user agent (control timeouts, proxies ...)
    you have full access.

        ## set HTTP request timeout
        my $wiki = WWW::Wikipedia->new();
        $wiki->timeout( 2 );

    You can turn off the following of wikipedia redirect directives by
    passing a false value to "follow_redirects".

  language()
    This allows you to get and set the language you want to use. Two letter
    language codes should be used. The default is 'en'.

        my $wiki = WWW::Wikipedia->new( language => 'es' );
    
        # Later on...
        $wiki->language( 'fr' );

  follow_redirects()
    By default, wikipeda redirect directives are followed. Set this to false
    to turn that off.

  search()
    Which performs the search and returns a WWW::Wikipedia::Entry object
    which you can query further. See WWW::Wikipedia::Entry docs for more
    info.

        $entry = $wiki->search( 'Perl' );
        print $entry->text();

    If there's a problem connecting to Wikipedia, "undef" will be returned
    and the error message will be stored in "error()".

  random()
    This method fetches a random wikipedia page.

  error()
    This is a generic error accessor/mutator. You can retrieve any searching
    error messages here.

TODO
    *   Clean up results. Strip HTML.

    *   Watch the development of Special:Export XML formatting, eg:
        http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Export/perl
